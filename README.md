## What is RAG
RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is a machine learning approach that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generative models. Here’s an overview of RAG:

## RAG based chatbot

Creating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot that utilizes PDFs as a knowledge base involves several steps, as outlined in your points. Here’s a detailed explanation of each step in the process:

### 1. Getting PDF

- **PDF Ingestion**: First, you need to obtain the PDF documents that will serve as the knowledge base for your chatbot. This can be done by collecting relevant PDFs from various sources, such as research papers, manuals, or documentation.
- **File Handling**: Use libraries like `PyMuPDF`, `PyPDF2`, or `pdfminer` in Python to read the content of the PDFs programmatically.

### 2. Splitting Document

- **Text Extraction**: Once the PDFs are read, extract the text content. This may include paragraphs, headings, tables, and other relevant sections.
- **Chunking**: Split the extracted text into smaller, manageable chunks (e.g., paragraphs or sections). This helps the retriever focus on relevant information without being overwhelmed by large volumes of text. You can also include metadata like section titles or page numbers for better context.

### 3. Generating Embeddings

- **Embedding Model**: Use a pre-trained language model (like BERT, Sentence Transformers, or OpenAI's models) to generate embeddings for each chunk of text. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text.
- **Batch Processing**: Depending on the size of your documents, consider processing chunks in batches to speed up the embedding generation.

### 4. Storing in Database

- **Database Selection**: Choose a suitable database for storing the embeddings and associated metadata. Options include vector databases like Pinecone, FAISS, or traditional databases like PostgreSQL with an extension for vector search (e.g., pgvector).
- **Data Insertion**: Store each chunk’s embedding along with its associated metadata (e.g., original text, document ID, chunk ID) in the database. This allows for efficient retrieval later.

### 5. Taking User Input

- **Input Handling**: Set up a user interface (UI) for the chatbot where users can input their queries. This could be a web-based chat interface or a command-line interface, depending on your requirements.
- **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the user input to ensure it's ready for the retrieval step (e.g., removing special characters, lowercasing).

### 6. Retrieving Relevant Chunks

- **Query Embedding**: Convert the user’s query into an embedding using the same embedding model used for the document chunks.
- **Similarity Search**: Use the query embedding to search the database for the most similar chunks. This involves calculating cosine similarity or other distance metrics to find the top-N relevant chunks based on their embeddings.

### 7. Creating Prompt Containing Chunks, Query, Conversation History

- **Prompt Construction**: Once the relevant chunks are retrieved, construct a prompt for the generative model. The prompt should include:
    - **User Query**: The original user query for context.
    - **Relevant Chunks**: The text from the retrieved chunks that may contain the answer.
    - **Conversation History**: Include previous interactions (if applicable) to provide continuity and context for the conversation.
- **Formatting**: Format the prompt in a way that clearly delineates the query, chunks, and any previous conversation history to guide the generative model effectively.

### 8. Generating a Response

- **Model Initialization**: Load the generative model (e.g., GPT-3, T5, or BART).
- **Response Generation**: Feed the constructed prompt into the generative model to generate a response. The model will use the context from the retrieved chunks and the user’s query to produce a relevant and coherent answer.
- **Output Handling**: Return the generated response to the user through the chatbot interface.
